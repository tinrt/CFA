cat a gitignore that ignores ds store files


Recognized macOS file exclusion request and prepared artifact.



I've created a .gitignore file that ignores .DS_Store files along with other common macOS system files and thumbnails. You can save this as .gitignore in your repository root.

If you only want the bare minimum, just the first line (.DS_Store) is sufficient, but the other entries are commonly ignored system files that you'll probably want


.env
